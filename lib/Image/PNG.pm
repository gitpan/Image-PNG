=head1 NAME

Image::PNG - Read and write PNG files



=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $png = Image::PNG->new ();
    $png->read_file ("crazy.png");
    printf "Your PNG is %d x %d\n", $png->width, $png->height;

=head1 General methods

=head2 new

    my $png = Image::PNG->new ();

Create a new PNG-file reading or writing object.

Options are

=over

=item read

    my $png = Image::PNG->new ({read => 'some.png'});

Set the file to read. The file is then read at the time of object
creation.

=item verbosity

    my $png = Image::PNG->new ({verbosity => 1});

If C<verbosity> is set to a true value, print verbose messages about
what the module is doing.

=back

=head2 read

    $png->read ("crazy.png")
        or die "Can't read it: " . $png->error ();

Read the PNG from the file name specified as the argument. This dies
if there is an error.

=head2 write

    $png->write ("crazy.png")
        or die "Can't write it: " . $png->error ();

Write the PNG to the file name specified as the argument. This dies
if there is an error.

=head2 data

     my $data = $png->data ();

Get the PNG image data as a Perl scalar.

=head2 error

Print the most recent error message.

=head1 PNG header-related methods

These methods are related to the PNG header (the IHDR chunk of the PNG
file). 

=head2 width

    my $height = $png->width ();

Get the width of the current PNG image.

=head2 height

    my $height = $png->height ();

Get the height of the current PNG image.

=head2 color_type

    my $color_type = $png->color_type ();

Get the name of the colour type of the current PNG image. The possible
return values are

=over

=item PALETTE

=item GRAY

=item GRAY_ALPHA

=item RGB

=item RGB_ALPHA

=back

=head2 bit_depth

    my $bit_depth = $png->bit_depth ();

Get the bit depth of the current PNG image.

=head2 interlacing_method

    my $interlacing_method = $png->interlacing_method ();

Get the name of the method of interlacing of the current PNG image.

There is no method for dealing with the compression method
field of the header, since this only has one possible value.

=head1 Image data-related methods

=head2 rowbytes

    my $rowbytes = $png->rowbytes;

This method returns the number of bytes in each row of the image. If
no image has been read yet, it returns the undefined value.

=head2 rows

    my $rows = $png->rows;

This method returns the rows of the image as an array reference,
C<$rows>. The array reference is a size equal to the height of the
image. Each element has the length of the number of bytes in one row
(as given by L</rowbytes>) plus one final zero byte. 

The row data returned is binary data and may contain several bytes
with the value zero.

=head1 Non-image chunks

=head2 text

    my @text = $png->text;

Get the text chunks of the image. Each element of the return value is
a hash reference. The keys are the fields of the PNG text chunk, and
the values are the values of those fields in the text chunk. The size
of the array is equal to the number of text chunks.

=head2 time

    my $time_ref = $png->time;
    print "The PNG was last modified in $time_ref->{year}.\n";

Get the last modified time of the image. The return value is a hash
reference containing the following six fields,

=over

=item year

=item month

=item day

=item hour

=item minute

=item second

=back

These represent the last modification time of the image. The
modification time of a PNG file is meant to be in the GMT (UCT) time
zone so there is no time zone information.

If there is no last modification time, the undefined value is returned
instead of a hash reference.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

There are some convenience functions in this module, exported on request.

=head2 display_text

     use Image::PNG qw/display_text/;
     my @text = $png->text;
     display_text ($text[3]);

Display the text chunk given as an argument on C<STDOUT>.

This is a convenience function for debugging rather than a
general-purpose routine.

=head1 SUPPORT

There is a mailing list for this Perl module at Google Groups. If you
have an enquiry, post to the mailing list. You don't have to join the
mailing list to post a message.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 In this distribution

=head3 Image::PNG::Const

L<Image::PNG::Const> contains the libpng constants taken from the libpng
header file "png.h".

=head3 Image::PNG::Libpng

L<Image::PNG::Libpng> provides a Perl mirror of the interface of the C
PNG library "libpng". Image::PNG is built on top of this module.

=head2 libpng download

To download libpng, see
L<http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html>. See also L</Alien::PNG>.

=head2 Other Perl modules on CPAN

=head3 Image::ExifTool

L<Image::ExifTool> is a pure Perl (doesn't require a C compiler)
solution for accessing the text segments of images. It has extensive
support for PNG text segments.

=head3 Alien::PNG

L<Alien::PNG> claims to be a way of "building, finding and using PNG
binaries". It may help in installing libpng. I didn't use it as a
dependency for this module because it seems not to work in batch mode,
but stop and prompt the user. I'm interested in hearing feedback from
users whether this works or not on various platforms.

=head3 Image::PNG::Rewriter

L<Image::PNG::Rewriter> is a utility for unpacking and recompressing
the IDAT (image data) part of a PNG image. The main purpose seems to
be to recompress the image data with the module author's other module
L<Compress::Deflate7>. Unfortunately that only works with Perl
versions 5.12.

=head3 Image::Pngslimmer

L<Image::Pngslimmer> reduces the size of dynamically created PNG
images. It's very, very slow at reading PNG data, but seems to work
OK.

=head3 Image::Info

L<Image::Info> is a module for getting information out of various
types of images. It has good support for PNG and is written in pure
Perl (doesn't require a C compiler). As well as basics such as height,
width, and colour type, it can get text chunks, modification time,
palette, gamma (gAMA chunk), resolution (pHYs chunk), and significant
bits (sBIT chunk). At the time of writing (version 1.31) it doesn't
support other chunks.



=head2 About the PNG format

There is L<an article on the format on Wikipedia|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics>.

=head3 The PNG specification

L<The PNG specification|http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/> (link to W3
consortium) explains the details of the PNG format.
