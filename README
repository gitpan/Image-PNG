This is the README for Image::PNG version 0.21.

Image::PNG is a "module" for the Perl computer programming language, a library
of computer code to install on a computer.  This document contains four
sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Image::PNG - Read and write PNG files

Image::PNG is a layer on top of "Image::PNG::Libpng". Whereas
"Image::PNG::Libpng" copies the interface of the C library "libpng",
Image::PNG is intended to be a more intuitive way to handle PNG
images. 

Please note that this module is not completed yet and is still under
development, so the interface may change. It's also open to
suggestions for improvements.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following websites:

    * http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Image::PNG
    * http://metacpan.org/release/Image-PNG

(These links go to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your computer
using

    perldoc Image::PNG

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. INSTALLATION

This module requires Perl version 5.8.1 or later.

To install the module from CPAN, use

    cpan Image::PNG

If you have the App::cpanminus installer, you may prefer

    cpanm Image::PNG

To install the module from the source file, Image-PNG-0.21.tar.gz, follow this
sequence of commands:

    tar xfz Image-PNG-0.21.tar.gz
    cd Image-PNG-0.21
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If you want to test the module before installing it, use "make test" after
"make" and before "make install".
